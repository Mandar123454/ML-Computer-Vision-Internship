Store trained weights and artifacts for each project in the subfolders:

- Animal_Detection/ — e.g., animal_detector.weights.h5 (or SavedModel), label maps
- Attendance_System/ — knn_classifier.pkl, facenet_model.h5
- CarColor_Detection/ — detector weights (e.g., yolov5s.pt or ONNX), class names
- Drowsiness_Detection/ — drowsiness_model.h5, age_model.h5
- Nationality_Detection/ — nationality_model.h5, emotion_model.h5
- SignLanguage_Detection/ — sign_language_model.h5

Include any auxiliary files (e.g., label maps, anchors, configs) required by the model you use.
