# SignLanguage_Detection models

Suggested artifacts:
- sign_language_model.h5 (CNN/LSTM or 3D CNN)
- label_map.txt (word list in index order)

Notes:
- The notebook shows a CNN-LSTM prototype trained on dummy data. Replace with real model and save here.
- Keep a mapping file for class index to word for the UI layers (Streamlit).
