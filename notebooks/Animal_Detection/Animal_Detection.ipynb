Since training failed in a previous step, using a pre-trained model is necessary. This single step covers integrating the model inference and using its output for visualization and counting for both image and video inputs, addressing multiple instructions.

            "1. Model Accuracy: The currently used pre-trained model (TF Hub EfficientDet Lite) is general object detection.\n",
            "   - It may not accurately detect all required animal species.\n",
            "   - Its ability to distinguish between carnivorous and non-carnivorous animals at the object detection level is limited to its training data.\n",
            "   - The mapping of generic class IDs (like 'cat', 'dog', 'bear') to specific carnivorous status might be inaccurate for some species/breeds.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Application Performance:\n",
            "   - Video processing speed depends on the model's inference time per frame and the overhead of reading/displaying frames using OpenCV/PyQt5.\n",
            "   - Drawing bounding boxes and labels on each frame adds processing time.\n",
            "   - The current implementation is synchronous; detection on one frame blocks the GUI until complete.\n",
            "\n",
            "--- Strategies for Improving Model Accuracy ---\n",
            "1. Fine-tuning: The most significant improvement would come from fine-tuning a pre-trained model (like a more powerful EfficientDet or a YOLO variant) on a large, diverse dataset specifically annotated with various animal species, including clear distinctions between carnivorous and non-carnivorous types where relevant.\n",
            "2. Model Selection: Explore other pre-trained models specifically trained or known to perform well on animal datasets (e.g., models trained on ImageNet with a wide variety of animal classes, or specialized animal detection models).\n",
            "3. Data Augmentation: If fine-tuning is possible, using advanced data augmentation techniques during training can improve robustness to variations in lighting, pose, and background.\n",
            "4. Post-processing Refinement: Improve the mapping of detected generic classes (e.g., 'bear') to specific types (e.g., 'polar bear' - carnivorous, 'panda' - non-carnivorous) if the model provides sufficient granularity or confidence scores allow for further classification.\n",
            "\n",
            "--- Performance Evaluation (Based on Implementation) ---\n",
            "1. Frame Rate: For video, the frame rate will be limited by the time taken for: reading a frame, converting to tensor, model inference, post-processing detections, drawing on the frame, converting back to QImage/QPixmap, and displaying.\n",
            "2. Resource Usage: Model inference is typically the most computationally intensive part, potentially leading to high CPU/GPU usage depending on the model size and hardware.\n",
            "3. Bottlenecks: Potential bottlenecks include model inference time, data conversion between OpenCV/NumPy and QImage/QPixmap, and the drawing operations, especially with many detections or high-resolution video.\n",
            "\n",
            "--- Optimization Techniques for Performance ---\n",
            "1. Model Optimization: Use a smaller, faster model if real-time performance is critical (e.g., EfficientDet Lite variants, MobileNet-based SSD). Quantization (e.g., converting model weights to INT8) can significantly speed up inference on compatible hardware.\n",
            "2. Inference Optimization: Utilize hardware acceleration (GPU) if available. Use optimized inference engines (e.g., TensorFlow Lite, TensorRT, OpenVINO) which can provide substantial speedups.\n",
            "3. Preprocessing/Postprocessing Optimization: Optimize image format conversions and drawing operations (e.g., using more efficient drawing methods if available, or performing drawing in a separate thread).\n",
            "4. Asynchronous Processing: Implement a producer-consumer pattern or threading to perform model inference on a separate thread, preventing the GUI from freezing during processing.\n",
            "5. Skip Frames: For very demanding models, process only every Nth frame in video to maintain a higher apparent frame rate, although this reduces temporal accuracy.\n",
