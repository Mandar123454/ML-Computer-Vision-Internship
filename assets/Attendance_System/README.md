# Attendance_System assets

- face reference images for enrolled people (e.g., reference/John_Doe_*.jpg)
- webcam snapshots or short clips for testing (test/*.jpg, *.mp4)

Accepted formats: .jpg, .png, .mp4

Tips:
- Use frontal faces with good lighting.
- Keep background simple to reduce false matches.
